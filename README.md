# Heart Disease Classifier
Heart disease is a common term that encompasses several types of cardiovascular conditions; all of which can often lead to death. The occurrence of heart disease is widespread throughout the world which makes it the number 1 cause of death globally (Lopez, 2023). Thus, it is important for those who may be experiencing symptoms to gain foresight on whether they have heart disease so they can take the necessary health measures. To try and provide such foresight to individuals I aim to answer the question: can we use health measurements (age, resting blood pressure, and serum cholesterol) from patients with a known diagnosis of heart disease, to predict whether future undiagnosed patients have heart disease? To answer this question, the Cleveland dataset, taken from the UCI Heart Disease database, will be used. The dataset includes the measurements of patients from medical procedures, some diagnosed with heart disease and some that did not have heart disease. There are 14 variables, including the diagnosis, and 303 observations (patients).
